Hi, I‚Äôm Jay Craswell @thetwin9000s or in the 1968 Film 2001 the earth bound Computer systems that noted that the on board HAL 9000 computer seemed to be in error Aka having a 
mental breakdown due (I think) being told to withhold information on why the Discovery spacecraft aka "Delta X-Ray One" was being sent to Jupiter Space.  While I was still a tiny 
tot when I was taken to see this it greatly influenced the direction of my life. I've worked in the world of computers since the 8080 days. I helped design a true Multiprocessor
(not multi core) with an error correcting memory system. I do PCB design from schematics.  I got fed up with drafting people doing my schematics (wrong), getting angry that 
I wanted a flow and comments.  I used the original OrCAD which was the first Schematic capture program that was good. *Great at the time. They sold out and the core of their 
team split up so I got interested in an all in one CAD system that worked from schematic to net-list to PCB layout to Gerbers or in reverse if one needed to reverse engineer a 
design that the documentation had gone missing or some upset CAD guy had bulk erased when he / she had a tantrum. I never found what I wanted and somehow talked the lead on 
the Multiprocessor project into making my dream CAD system. I spent a year plus (and made my brain hurt) to write the logic to a through hole era autorouter and helped 
(in a small way) the non PARC style logic of a the worlds greatest CAD system Circad (powered by Omniglyph) https://www.holophase.com   I am active and interested in public 
service (US Army MARS operator, Civil Air Patrol, Police Reserve (Eons ago) In short I have been active in something almost all of my life.

Among many other projects I wrote the code for a CAM system and designed its hardware all using a single 8051. I think I write ‚Äúfair code‚Äù that is readable so that at least in 
one instance a customer who had never written a line of code in his life added functions to my code because it was "so well explained in its source" I am supposed to have been 
tested as having a high IQ but informed by my parents that even if so (Highly doubtful as my father referred to me as Irving Dumb Dumb) it amounts to nothing but a number if you 
don't do any actual work with it.  

I read quite fast with good comprehension but at times have an answer but little clue where I got it. I‚Äôve read most of a Jr High School Library. I've done 
research and development for one of the top companies in the state.  Currently I have chosen to avoid the time wasting "system" of corporate cubicles, the sound of constant 
phones ringing,  endless (pointless meetings) and working with people focused on making money for doing little to nothing or worst of all writing bug filled code that they 
maintain and continue to fix forever. Offices with doors, quiet working areas, collaboration with peers, working on things that work as fast as the hardware is capable of 
without bugs is my thing and I don't believe such places exist any longer.  I think real programmers and hardware designers can be counted using my fingers. Toes as well as 
I'm not often overseas so I don't know.  Truth is I've been out of the system so long as far as I know it maybe a great deal more but I suspect the people who really understand 
what is going on are less then I think.

- üëÄ I‚Äôm interested in ‚Ä¶ Hardware design language, Machine oriented Language (M.O.L), Stage2, Assembler Language using in circuit emulation for development and debug. 
Mostly anything NOT made by Microsoft or Intel. I couldn‚Äôt care less about ‚Äústandards‚Äù as most suffer the too many cooks spoil the broth thing. Occasionally I try to get a 
handle on C++ but the obsession with curly braces, lack of comments, grabbing of big blocks of code from only God knows where and the many abstraction layers and bloated code 
it generates... Makes me vomit.  

I'm more thought of as a hardware person but I was once titled the "Mush-ware" person as I was able to cross the divide between departments.  On the hardware side I'm 
interested in CPU design and a rethink of the operating systems we currently use and how we use MIPs like water rendering machines that make what I first thought of as a 
"super computer" speed machine to unusable slow garbage systems. I believe everything we've come to accept as "normal"
is the very routine of making what we have old, slow and obsolescence every 1.5 years forcing us to buy new everything.  Which I think is pure marketing bullshit. I won't 
argue its financially successful and made a lot of people rich but I prefer not to be one of the mindless swarming masses.  I'm not interested in are spending time vegging out 
to any video game.  Life is short and I doubt anyone will be breathing their last breath wishing they had spent more time playing Space Potatoes. I dislike obscufication and 
believe its close to satanic to spend time making things even less understandable then the crap I see that has not been obscuficated. 

Per a comment from my friend the late (and great) Frank Huber I'm interested in people who know they don't know everything but do know quite a bit. The brilliant but humble. 
I don't care for people who know nothing and are convinced they know everything. Also those that know a few things then believe that this now makes them know everything 
(and so forth) I also like to question authority (Obviously)  I‚Äôm less interested in money then I am living the experience. I like the occasional cult films, go between pure 
hate or disinterest of music to relief when a band saves music for me.  Examples being the White Stripes when the pop music of that era was unlistenable. Weezer which I became
a moderately insane fan boy of.  *And yes I do think the Matt Sharp era was the best and am sad Ellon Musk is making him sad. 

 I am part of a beyond cult band Joe Grow and the Atomic Trashcan Band, formerly a member of Adolph Hitliar and the Casuals and Joe Grow and the meaningful ooze with burning 
 sensation and painful discharge. I do not wish anyone thinking there is any positive connection with Hitler. It was simply suggested to me that a Punk Rock band could really 
 use a punk like Hitler. The possible connection made that act short lived.

Surprisingly I believe in a higher power.  Something better then man. This view is the Charlton Heston school of thought based on his movie ‚ÄúPlanet of the apes‚Äù where he said 
something to the effect that with the known universe being so vast and having been around for so long there must be something greater then man. Just has to be!  Work out a 
scale model of the solar system with the sun the size of a basketball.  Crazy large gaps of blank space.  Now work it out to the nearest star then the other side of our Galaxy. 
I‚Äôm not too keen on organized religion that seems to mostly be an excuse to ‚Äúspeak for God‚Äù because they know what God thinks.  

I work too many hours and drink too much Caffeine. It used to be 26 (small) cups of coffee but now its Sundrop Soda (Another Cult thing.) I had to have it explained to me that 
80 hour work weeks were not the norm.  I still have no idea how people working 40 get anything done.

- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ‚Ä¶ This is dull, but to pay the bills I am learning about Thales Racal Military Handheld radios and doing grunt work on rehabbing them and other once 
expensive two way radios for resale to people in the Civil Air Patrol (Who do Search and Rescue, disaster relief etc as the poor orphan sons of the USAF) Thus I'm forced to 
learn some arcane programs that set up various radios with channel, zone, frequency, nac, tone, etc etc etc.  Very good work for perfectionists because it all has to be either 
A+ / Four Oh or its fail...  *And I am used to working in that environment.  Your work is perfect or get out and go work in engineering. Tuning up and repairing and programming 
radios is a bit mind numbingly boring at times but am happy when customers are "wowed" even if its almost nothing work.

I am interested in FPGA design but dreading learning its syntax. I assume it will have many of the same issues I have with C++ I have only the slightest background with the 
earliest Xylinx components.  I did do a lot of work with PALs and built one of the first true colour display boards with a handful and some TTL before anyone had Video Dacs 
available.  (Totem pole resistor ladder ‚Äì thanks to a suggestion by Fred Lehman / Circad / Multiprocessor, Master of the computer display and great builder of the sailing 
vessel ‚ÄúFirst Love‚Äù) Now that these programmable sorts of things are large enough to make a reasonably fast CPU I am re-pondering Knuth's hypothetical CPU and thinking of what 
is really important in a machine designed without any baggage of compatibility with prior designs.  And in particular one not geared to high level languages. I consider them to 
be "Esperanto" when learning the native language (of the machine) is better than everyone having a ‚ÄúLanguage Abstraction Layer‚Äù 

I do not wish to engage in arguments or debates about... anything. Life is short and I will be much happier working on my thing rather then hear why you think mine is wrong 
(And use a popularity poll to prove it)  

If you can't measure it? I don't think its science. Science is not now or never been a popularity poll of "experts" Every generation of experts has been sure that because they 
memorized something someone else announced as fact it made it so.  And by my limited study of this the majority seems to be wrong in every generation yet we continue this 
nonsense over and over. I think school that teaches how to learn rather than memorizing tables and facts and learning how to take tests would be a huge improvement but see 
very little sign that this is the focus.  Politics instead seem to be the focus which makes me wonder why anyone would willingly spend 4, 6 or more years being schooled on 
some political slant when there are far more important things to be done.  I once dabbled in being a grunt in a political party and was a bit shocked at the endless quest for 
creating new laws (Filling rooms insuring we are all guilty of something) and spending insane amounts of money when few to any of the elected had ever worked in a real job much 
less run a company.

- üíûÔ∏è I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ... nothing at this time.

- üì´ How to reach me ... Email me at my not very often checked twin9000s@gmail.com  I can be reached by phone but don't listen to messages (voicemail)  I do respond to 
texts usually straight away but am loath to post my cell number. There are accounts for me on Facebook, Twitter and God knows what else. I think this has been mostly a waste of 
my time that I can never get back so please don‚Äôt contact me there and be upset if my response doesn‚Äôt come back in a month or 3. Ditto LinkedIn and whatever other public 
forums I‚Äôve signed up for.  Once I get the time I shall try to remove myself from such things but‚Ä¶ Maybe its best to just ignore them?
